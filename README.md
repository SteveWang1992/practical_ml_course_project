# practical_ml_course_project
This repo is created for data science specialization track practical machine learning course week 4 project.

## File List

- ml_project_training.csv (containing all the training data needed for the model training and validation)
- ml_project_training.csv (containing all the testing data needed for the project predication purpose)
- Practical_ML_Project.html (The html file documented all the analysis and model training procedures)
- Practical_ML_Project.Rmd (R Markdown file for reproducible research purpose)

For the convenient use of the training and testing dataset, I upload the two datasets needed for the project to this github repo.
So other users will not need to worry about getting the data through the original website.
